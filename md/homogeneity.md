### Omogeneita' delle serie

Scopo dei valori normali:
- as an indicator of the conditions most likely to be experienced at a given location under the current climate
- as a benchmark against which climatic conditions at a given location (or in a given region) in a given time period can be compared

A questo scopo i dati durante il periodo climatologico debbono essere consistenti , e rappresentativi dei dati rispetto a cui si vogliono fare i confronti.

```
For example, if data from 2017 are being compared with those for an averaging period from 1981 to 2010, 
the site and instruments used in the 1981â€“2010 period need to be representative of those in use in 2017.
Meeting these requirements requires that the data used be homogeneous over the averaging period, and, if 
they are being used as a reference for the current period, from the averaging period to the present. 
This means that any changes in the data reflect only changes in the background climate, and not changes in 
the way the observations are made or in 
the environment in which they are made.
